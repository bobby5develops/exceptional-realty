It's good, thanks. But how to ignore some directories, such as target, out, production?

Great resource - many thanks for sharing.

Some examples with directories per https://gist.github.com/ThomsonTang suggestion would help round out this already excellent tip

I think .dll files are important if you're developing with .NET.

Also, you could include .ai, .eps, and .psd on it.

Thanks, for the great snippet.
